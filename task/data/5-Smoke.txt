Review - text, rating, author
1. “I’m Commander Shepard and this is my favorite game on Smoke”, 10, Commander Shepard
2. “The Moo remake sets a new standard for the future of the survival horror series⁠, even if it isn't the sequel I've been pining for.”, 12, Driver
3. “Universe of Technology is a spectacular 4X game, that manages to shine even when the main campaign doesn't.”, 15, lemon
4. “Moo’s interesting art design can't save it from its glitches, bugs, and myriad terrible game design decisions, but I love its sound design”, 2, Bonet
5. “I've played this game for years nonstop. Over 8k hours logged (not even joking). And I'm gonna tell you: at this point, the game's just not worth playing anymore. I think it hasn't been worth playing for a year or two now, but I'm only just starting to realize it. It breaks my heart to say that, but that's just the truth of the matter.”, 5, Szredor
