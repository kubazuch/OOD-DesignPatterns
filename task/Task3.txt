Today's task is about extending functionality of the applications.
During this laboratory you will add to your applications collections and simple algorithms that work on them.

1. Create two collections of the same interface:
    - doubly linked list,
    - vector (similar to c# list and c++ std::vector)
   Each collection should allow:
    - adding objects regardless of their representation,
    - deleting objects regardless of their representation,
    - getting forward and reverse iterator.
2. Write 2 algorithms:
    - find algorithm, which takes collection (collection interface definied above), predicate (Func object) which returns first object for which predicate is TRUE or null value and search direction (bool) indicating whether we start looking for object at the beginning or at the end of the collection,
    - print algorithm, arguments as above, which prints all of the objects in a collection for which predicate returns TRUE, return value is void.

Adding new collection shouldn't require changes to the algorithms!!!
