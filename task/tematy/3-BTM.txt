In Bytezaria, the largest city of Byteotia founded in binary 1011111001 by
King Byte II, there is public transport consisting of bytebuses and trambits.
BTM (Byteasar urban transport) is divided into lines, each line is described
by a hexadecimal number (written as a string) and the same number written in
decimal format (positive int), additionally each line has a colloquial name
(string) used by Byteasars, for each the line is assigned a list of *stops*
and a list of *vehicles* (buses and trams). Each stop has an id (positive
int), a list of *lines* that use it, a name (string) and a string indicating
whether it is a bus or tram stop ("bus", "tram", "other"). The vehicle can be
either a bytebus or a trambit. A bytobus has an id (positive int), a list of
*lines* it runs on and a motor class (string - "Byte5", "bisel20" and
"gibgaz". Each tram has an id (positive int), number of cars (positive int)
and * line* to which it is assigned. Since vehicles are not autonomous, they
must be driven by drivers. Each driver has a list of *vehicles* they drive,
name (string), surname (string) and seniority in years (positive int).

Possible representations:
	0 - Base representation. Objects with references - references are used for connections between objects.
		Line
			- numberHex (string)
			- numberDec (int)
			- commonName (string)
			- stops (list of stops refs)
			- vehicles (list of vehicles refs)
			
		Stop
			- id (int)
			- lines (list of lines refs)
			- name (string)
			- type (enum string)
			
		Bytebus : Vehicle
			- id (int)
			- lines (list of lines refs)
			- engineClass (enum string)
		
		Tram : Vehicle
			- id (int)
			- carsNumber (int)
			- line (line ref)

		Driver
			- vehicles (list of vehicles refs)
			- name (string)
			- surname (string)
			- seniority (int)
			
	1. Objects with indexes - like 0. but instead of references objects use
	id or numberDec corresponding to referenced object.

	2. Text - all objects are represented as single string containing all the data in format specified below.
	References to objects are handled like 1.
		Line - "<numerHex>(<numerDec>)`<commonName>`@<stop id>,...!<vehicle id>,..."
		Stop - "#<id>(<line id>,...)<name>/<typ>"
		Bytebus - "#<id>^<engineClass>*<line id>,..."
		Tram - "#<id>(<carsNumber>)<line id>,..."
		Driver - "<name> <surname>(<seniority>)@<vehicle id>,..."
		
		Notation used:
			<-> - value ( - is a name of field)
			[-] - optional ( - is a name of field)
			-,... - possible repetitions ( - is a string of tokens that can logically repeat)

	3. Partial text - some fields contain nonatomic data. Mix between objects with references and text representations.
	References to objects are handled like 1.
		Line
			- number "<numerHex>(<numerDec>)"
			- commonName (string)
			- stops "<stop id>,..."
			- vehicles "<vehicle id>,..."
			
		Stop
			- name "(<id>)<name>"
			- type (enum string)
			- lines "<line id>,..."
			
		Bytebus
			- engineClass (enum string)
			- description "#<id>*<line id>,..."

		Tram
			- lines "<line id>,..."
			- description "#<id>(<wagony>)"
			
		Driver
			- identity "<surname>,<name>"
			- seniority (int)
			- vehicles "<vehicle id>,..."

	4. Hashmap - representation like 1., but every non-reference field is key (int) in common map int->string. 
	Each key is C# hash of that string (using builtin C# hash).

	5. Semi-binary format: Each class have additional field named "data" which is array of bytes. Rest is like 
	in 1., but instead of each field we have "<fieldname>_addr" and "<fieldname_count>". "<fieldname>_addr" 
	is address (index) of data of that field in array "data" and "<fieldname_count>" is number of elements 
	(in case of list type - number of elements, otherwise 1, if element is optional it may be 0 and _addr doesn't matter).

	6.Each class contain id (int) and map string->string.
	Representation is similar to 1. but data is accesed as string in that map.
	For simple types the key is field name and value is field value as string. For array types there are keys
	"fieldname.Size()" to get number of elements of array and "fieldname[i]" to get given element of array (all as string).

	7. Representation like 1. but class have only list of pairs (fieldname, value). 
	So have List<Tuple<string, Object>> to represent each object. That value of type Object must 
	be casted to propter type to be used.

	8. All objects are represented as pairs Tuple<int,Stack<string>>, where the first item is the corresponding object's ID, same as in representation 1.
	The second item is a stack, where data is stored as follows:
	1) push field value (or all IDs of referenced objects),
	2) push 1 (or the number of referenced object IDs),
	3) push field name,
	4) repeat for the other fields, in the same order as listed in the base representation (0).
