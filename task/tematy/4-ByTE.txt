The ByTE Faculty of the Bajtocjan University of Technology is the best
university teaching computer science in the country. The faculty is
divided into rooms where classes are held. Each room is assigned a unique
number (positive int), typee of room (string type - "laboratory", "training",
"lecture", "other") list of classes taking place in it along with their
dates (list of * classes*). Each class held on ByTE has a unique name (string), subject code (string), duration
in lesson units (non-negative int) and a list of *teachers* and *students*.
Each lecturer has names (string list), surname (string), rank (string - "KiB",
"MiB", "GiB" and "TiB"), his code (string) in the BitTEX system and the
list of classes he teaches. Each student has similar fields, except for
the degree, instead of the list of classes, he has a list of classes he
attends, additionally he also has a field specifying the semester of study
(positive integer). In addition, each lecturer can be a student in some classes.

Possible representations:
	0 - Base representation. Objects with references - references are used for connections between objects.
		Room
			- number (int)
			- type (enum)
			- classes (list of class ref)
			
		Class
			- name (string)
			- code (string)
			- duration (int)
			- teachers (list of teachers refs)
			- students (list of students refs)
			
		Teacher
			- names (list string)
			- surname (string)
			- rank (enum)
			- code (string)
			- classes (list of classes refs)
		
		Student
			- names (list string)
			- surname (string)
			- semester (int)
			- code (string)
			- classes (list of classes refs)
			
	1. Objects with indexes - like 0. but instead of references objects use unique code (string)
	corresponding to referenced object.

	2. Text - all objects are represented as single string containing all the data in format specified below.
	References to objects are handled like 1.
		Room - "<number>(<type>),(<class code>),..."
		Class - "<name>#<code>(<duration>)^<teacher code>,...$<student code>,..."
		Teacher - "<surname>,<name>...*<rank>(<code>)^<class code>,..."
		Student - "<surname>,<name>...@<semester>(<code>)^<class code>,..."
		
		Notation used:
			<-> - value ( - is a name of field)
			[-] - optional ( - is a name of field)
			-,... - possible repetitions ( - is a string of tokens that can logically repeat)

	3. Partial text - some fields contain nonatomic data. Mix between objects with references and text representations.
	References to objects are handled like 1.
		Room
			- number (int)
			- type (string)
			- classes "(<class code>),..."

		Class
			- name (string)
			- code (string)
			- duration (int)
			- people "<teacher code>,...$<student code>,..."
			
		Teacher
			- identity "<surname>,<name>,..."
			- rank (string)
			- code (string)
			- classes "<class code>,..."
			
		Student
			- identity "<surname>,<name>,..."
			- semester (int)
			- code (string)
			- classes "<class code>,..."


	4. Hashmap - representation like 1., but every non-reference field is key (int) in common map int->string. 
	Each key is C# hash of that string (using builtin C# hash).

	5. Semi-binary format: Each class have additional field named "data" which is array of bytes. Rest is like 
	in 1., but instead of each field we have "<fieldname>_addr" and "<fieldname_count>". "<fieldname>_addr" 
	is address (index) of data of that field in array "data" and "<fieldname_count>" is number of elements 
	(in case of list type - number of elements, otherwise 1, if element is optional it may be 0 and _addr doesn't matter).

	6.Each class contain id (int) and map string->string.
	Representation is similar to 1. but data is accesed as string in that map.
	For simple types the key is field name and value is field value as string. For array types there are keys
	"fieldname.Size()" to get number of elements of array and "fieldname[i]" to get given element of array (all as string).

	7. Representation like 1. but class have only list of pairs (fieldname, value). 
	So have List<Tuple<string, Object>> to represent each object. That value of type Object must 
	be casted to propter type to be used.

	8. All objects are represented as pairs Tuple<int,Stack<string>>, where the first item is the corresponding object's ID, same as in representation 1.
	The second item is a stack, where data is stored as follows:
	1) push field value (or all IDs of referenced objects),
	2) push 1 (or the number of referenced object IDs),
	3) push field name,
	4) repeat for the other fields, in the same order as listed in the base representation (0).
